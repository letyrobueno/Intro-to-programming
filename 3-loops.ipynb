    "1. Change the First Example above and write a program that extracts the digits of a decimal number and prints their sum. For example, if you're given the number $1524$, the program should print: \"The sum of the digits of the number $1524$ is $12$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Again consider the First Example above and change the program so that it prints the number of digits and the sum of even numbers. For example, for the number $1524$ the number of digits would be $4$ and the sum of even numbers would be $2 + 4 = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a program that prints the numbers from $1$ to $100$. But for the multiples of three it must print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five it prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it must print “FizzBuzz”.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make a program that takes three integer numbers: $a$, $b$ and $c$, where $a$ must be greater than $1$. The program must return the sum of all integers between $b$ and $c$ that are multiples of $a$ (including $b$ and $c$).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a program that takes a positive number $n$ (it should verify if $n$ is positive) and returns if $n$ is prime. Consider that: \n",
    "    * if $n=1$ or $n=2$, then $n$ is prime; \n",
    "    * it is only necessary to search by the dividers of $n$ in the range $2$ to $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that can be read from left to right or from right to left. Write a program that reads a positive integer with $5$ digits and determines if it is a palindrome. The program should verify invalid inputs (in this case, allow the user to enter with a new value).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What would you have to change on the first for-loop in the Section (1.1) to make it go downward instead of upward? That is, instead of $i=1,2,3,\\ldots,n$ we would have $i=n,n-1,\\ldots,3,2,1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Write an algorithm that takes a positive integer $n$. Next, the algorithm must read $n$ integers and return the largest and the smallest number among all the $n$ numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Write an algorithm that reads a positive integer $n$. Next, the algorithm must calculate the arithmetic progression from $1$ to $n$, that is: $1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n$. It's known that this can be calculated by $\\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$ where $a_1$ and $a_n$ are the first and last numbers, respectively. However, in this exercise you should make the calculation using a loop, even though you could use the formula as well to compare the values and make sure the algorithm is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Write an algorithm that reads a positive integer $n$ and calculates $n!$ (the factorial of $n$). Remember that: <br>\n",
    "    <center>$n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * \\ldots * 2 * 1$. </center>\n",
    "<b>Hint</b>: since the factorial operation has an exponential growth rate, test your program with small values for $n$."
