Therefore, we will keep the activities on Jupyter Notebooks and will use an IDE just in the next module (namely Oriented-Object Programming - OOP). This way we can now keep our attention on the programming logic itself, which is difficult enough for students with no programming knowledge, and we keep everything related to OOP concepts closed in the next module (since even the main procedure needs an OOP explanation).\n",

In addition, they can be classified according to the type of information as, for example, text (`char`), integer numbers (`byte`, `short`, `int` or `long`), real numbers (`float` or `double`), logical (`boolean`), and the constructed type (which we are going to study afterwards).\n",
